# Joke Generator

For this refresher, we are going to build a Joke Generator

DO NOT worry about style until you get the initial functionality together. This is a lightning exercise, so it is meant to be completed in 30 minutes or less.

Make a quick plan and then execute it.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. When a user first loads the app, a button appears on the DOM that reads "Get a Joke"
1. When the user presses the "Get a Joke" button, an API call is made to the joke API and the joke setup appears on the DOM.
1. When a user presses the "Get a Joke" button, the button text changes to "Get Punchline"
1. When a user presses the "Get Punchline" button, both the joke setup and delivery are on the DOM along with a button that reads "Get Another Joke"
1. When the user presses the "Get Another Joke" button, the app starts over from step 3.
